## Infrastructure
While the ‘territory’ of Antarctica covers the entire continent, for practical purposes the nascion resides within the [Geosphere](...); any [area](...) outside this is known as ‘wasteland’ or ‘frostland’.

Antarctica is divided into 12 [*districts*](...), each containing several *citys*.

| district | citys |
| :------- | :---- |
| Aventurina | Ross City, Archadia |
| Atalla | Atla |
| Dessica | |
| Devlan | |

## Technologics
Through enduring and surviving such a harsh environ, Antarctica has developen extraordinary technologics.

To allow the region to remain confortively inhabitable, a {...} called the *Geosphere* encloses the majoricy of the continent. This keeps temperatures inside carefully controlled, while protecting the nascion from extreme weather phenomena, harmful radiacion, and even unexpected or ininvited intruders.

Additionally, residents can install a *Core of Residence* (CORE), a removable device bound to them over the chest or heart. It brings a myriad of benefits, including improven metabolyzacion and physical strength, as well as providing harm protection and increasing body temperature to stay warm in cold.

## Society
At its heart, Antarctica is advancive.

## Military

Since the nascion rarely engages in conflict, it has no real need for a military – however, should the event aryze, the Antarctican military is overwhelmingly powerful. It has [ground](...), [sea](...), [air](...), [space](...) forces, featuring an endless array of [weaponcraft](–/lan/dict.md#weaponcraft) and [transcraft](...).

[Involucion](–/lan/...) is not [mandative](–/lan/...) at all. Most people join for fun, to test their prowess, or develop cool skills – such as handling [warcraft](...) or strategical thinking.
