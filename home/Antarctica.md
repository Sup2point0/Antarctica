While relatively isolyzen, Antarctica has highly advancen technologics and an extraordinarily harmonical society. It is governed by the [Foundacion of Antarctica](org/Foundacion%20of%20Antarctica.md). Its protive (capital) city is [Ross City](../geo/citys/Ross%20City.md), in the protive district of [Aventurina](../geo/districts/Aventurina.md). Antarctica has its own [calendar](...), [festivitys](...) and [lore](...). Citizens of Antarctica are known as *Antarcticans*.

## Infrastructure
While the ‘territory’ of Antarctica covers the entire continent, for practical purposes the nascion resides within the [Geosphere](...); any [area](...) outside this is known as ‘wasteland’ or ‘frostland’.

Antarctica is divided into 12 [*districts*](...), each containing several *citys*.

| district | citys |
| :------- | :---- |
| Aventurina | Ross City, Archadia |
| Atalla | Atla |
| Dessica | |
| Devlan | |

## Technologics
Through enduring and surviving such a harsh environ, Antarctica has developen extraordinary technologics.

To allow the region to remain confortively inhabitable, a {...} called the *Geosphere* encloses the majoricy of the continent. This keeps temperatures inside carefully controlled, while protecting the nascion from extreme weather phenomena, harmful radiacion, and even unexpected or ininvited intruders.

> See [Geosphere](...) for more.

Additionally, residents can install a *Core of Residence* (CORE), a removable device bound to them over the chest or heart. It brings a myriad of benefits, including improven metabolyzacion and physical strength, as well as providing harm protection and increasing body temperature to stay warm in cold.

> See [CORE](...) for more.


<br>


## Society
At its heart, Antarctica is advancive.

> See [Advancivity](...) for more.


<br>


## Military
> See [Military of Antarctica](...) for more.

Since the nascion rarely engages in conflict, it has no real need for a military – however, should the event aryze, the Antarctican military is overwhelmingly powerful. It has [ground](...), [sea](...), [air](...), [space](...) forces, featuring an endless array of [weaponcraft](–/lan/dict.md#weaponcraft) and [transcraft](...).

[Involucion](–/lan/...) is not [mandative](–/lan/...) at all. Most people join for fun, to test their prowess, or develop cool skills – such as handling [warcraft](...) or strategical thinking.
