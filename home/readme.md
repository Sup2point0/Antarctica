The **Nascion of Antarctica**, [officiatively](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'officially') the *Unyzen Nascion of Antarctica*, simply ‘Antarctica’, is a [advancive](–/Advancivity.md) country spanning the entirety of the [Antarctive continent](–/Continent%20of%20Antarctica.md) of the same name at the very south of the Earth, with a [moderative](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'moderate') [populyzacion](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'population') of ~0.2 [deutillion](../logistics/linque/series.md#-illion 'billion') people.

While relatively [isolyzen](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'isolated'), Antarctica has highly [advancen](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'advanced') technologics and an extraordinarily harmonical society. It is [governyzen](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'governed') by the [Foundacion of Antarctica](organyzacions/Foundacion%20of%20Antarctica.md). Its protive (capital) city is [Ross City](../geographics/citys/Ross%20City.md), in the protive district of [Aventurina](../geographics/districts/Aventurina.md). Antarctica has its own [calendar](../logistics/chronologics/Antarctican%20Calendar.md), [festivitys](...) and [lore](...). Citizens of Antarctica are known as *Antarcticans*.

## Geographics
> See [Continent of Antarctica](...) for more.

Terrain [varys](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'varies') wildly across Antarctica, although ice remains visible anywhere. Some districts embrace the harsh and jagged natural landscape, featuring fearsome ice spikes and sharp ice cliffs, [untouchen](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'untouched') from anthropological interference. Ice is far less [prominant](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'prominent') in newer districts, which were [redevelopen](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'redeveloped') after battles and conflicts, but the artificial structures are no less [exhilaryzing](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'exhilarating'). The outskirts of the continent are [inconsistant](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'inconsistent') due to [disrupcion](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'disruption') in the past, but retain some incredible landscapes, including [anciant](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'ancient') ice caverns and ice [oasys](../logistics/linque/dict.md#oasys 'oases').

Naturally, temperatures are exceedingly low, with blizzards and other extreme weather phenomena being fairly frequent. Antarctica has 2 seasons, with each spanning half the year: during Winter, it is very, very cold and dark indeed; during Summer, temperatures rise up to near -7[°V](–/Velqins.md) (~0°C).

## Infrastructure

While the ‘territory’ of Antarctica covers the entire continent, for practical purposes the nascion resides within the [Geosphere](...); any [area](...) outside this is known as ‘wasteland’ or ‘frostland’.

Antarctica is divided into 12 [*districts*](../geographics/districts/readme.md), each containing several [*citys*](../geographics/citys/readme.md).

| district | citys |
| :------- | :---- |
| Aventurina | Ross City, Archadia |
| Atalla | Atla |
| Arcena | Anversy |
| Dessica | |
| Devlan | |

## Technologics

Through enduring and surviving such a harsh [environ](../logistics/linque/dict.md#environ 'environment'), Antarctica has [developen](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'developed') extraordinary technologics.

To allow the region to remain [confortively](../logistics/linque/dict.md#confortively 'comfortably') inhabitable, a [SPACES](... 'Spherical Protective Artificive Continent-Enclosing Systic') called the *Geosphere* encloses the [majoricy](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'majority') of the continent. This keeps temperatures inside constant and sufficiently high, while protecting the nascion from extreme weather phenomena, harmful radiacion, and even [unexpecten](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'unexpected') or [uninviten](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'uninvited') intruders.

> See [Geosphere](...) for more.

[Addicionally](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'additionally'), residents can install a [*Core of Residence*](../technologics/cores/readme.md) (CORE), a removable device bound to them over the chest or heart. It brings a myriad of benefits, including [improven](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'improved') [metabolyzacion](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'metabolism') and physical strength, as well as providing harm [proteccion](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'protection') and increasing body temperature to stay warm.

> See [CORE](...) for more.


<br>


## Society
> See [Advancivity](–/Advancivity.md) for more.

At its heart, Antarctica is advancive.


<br>


## Military
> See [Military of Antarctica](...) for more.

Since the nascion rarely engages in conflict, it has no real need for a military – however, should the event [aryze](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'arise'), the Antarctican military is overwhelmingly powerful. It has [ground](...), [sea](...), [air](...), [space](...) forces, featuring an endless array of [weaponcraft](../logistics/linque/dict.md#weaponcraft 'weaponry') and [transcraft](../logistics/linque/dict.md#transcraft 'transport').

[Involucion](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'involvement') is not [mandative](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'mandatory') at all. Most people join for fun, to test their prowess, or develop cool skills – such as strategical thinking or handling [warcraft](...).
