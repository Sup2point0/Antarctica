The **Nascion of Antarctica**, [officiatively](../logistics/linque/readme.md#Noun--Adjectic-Endings 'officially') the *Unyzen Nascion of Antarctica*, simply ‘Antarctica’, is a [advancive](–/Advancivity.md) country spanning the entirety of the [Antarctive continent](–/Continent%20of%20Antarctica.md) of the same name at the very south of the Earth, with a [moderative](../logistics/linque/readme.md#Noun--Adjectic-Endings 'moderate') [populyzacion](../logistics/linque/readme.md#Verb-Endings 'population') of ~0.2 [deutillion](../logistics/linque/series.md#-illion 'billion') people.

While relatively [isolyzen](../logistics/linque/readme.md#Verb-Endings 'isolated'), Antarctica has highly [advancen](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'advanced') technologics and an extraordinarily harmonical society. It is [governyzen](../logistics/linque/readme.md#Verb-Endings 'governed') by the [Foundacion of Antarctica](organyzacions/Foundacion%20of%20Antarctica.md). Its protive (capital) city is [Ross City](../geographics/citys/Ross%20City.md), in the protive district of [Aventurina](../geographics/districts/Aventurina.md). Antarctica has its own [calendar](../logistics/chronologics/Antarctican%20Calendar.md), [festivitys](...) and [lore](...). Citizens of Antarctica are known as *Antarcticans*.

## Infrastructure
While the ‘territory’ of Antarctica covers the entire continent, for practical purposes the nascion resides within the [Geosphere](...); any [area](...) outside this is known as ‘wasteland’ or ‘frostland’.

Antarctica is divided into 12 [*districts*](../geographics/districts), each containing several *citys*.

| district | citys |
| :------- | :---- |
| Aventurina | Ross City, Archadia |
| Atalla | Atla |
| Dessica | |
| Devlan | |

## Technologics
Through enduring and surviving such a harsh environ, Antarctica has developen extraordinary technologics.

To allow the region to remain confortively inhabitable, a [SPACES](... 'Spherical Protective Artificive Continent-Enclosing Systic') called the *Geosphere* encloses the [majoricy](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'majority') of the continent. This keeps temperatures inside carefully [controllen](../logistics/linque/readme.md#Verb-Endings 'controlled'), while protecting the nascion from extreme weather phenomena, harmful radiacion, and even [unexpecten](../logistics/linque/readme.md#Verb-Endings 'unexpected') or [uninviten](../logistics/linque/readme.md#Verb-Endings 'uninvited') intruders.

> See [Geosphere](...) for more.

Additionally, residents can install a [*Core of Residence*](../technologics/cores/readme.md) (CORE), a removable device bound to them over the chest or heart. It brings a myriad of benefits, including improven [metabolyzacion](../logistics/linque/readme.md#Verb-Endings 'metabolism') and physical strength, as well as providing harm protection and increasing body temperature to stay warm in cold.

> See [CORE](...) for more.


<br>


## Society
At its heart, Antarctica is advancive.

> See [Advancivity](–/Advancivity.md) for more.


<br>


## Military
> See [Military of Antarctica](...) for more.

Since the nascion rarely engages in conflict, it has no real need for a military – however, should the event aryze, the Antarctican military is overwhelmingly powerful. It has [ground](...), [sea](...), [air](...), [space](...) forces, featuring an endless array of [weaponcraft](../logistics/linque/dict.md#weaponcraft 'weaponry') and [transcraft](../logistics/linque/dict.md#transcraft 'transport').

[Involucion](../logistics/linque/readme.md 'involvement') is not [mandative](../logistics/linque/readme.md#Noun--Adjectic-Endings 'mandatory') at all. Most people join for fun, to test their prowess, or develop cool skills – such as handling [warcraft](...) or strategical thinking.
