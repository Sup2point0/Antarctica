# Educyzacion Systic of Antarctica

The [systic](... 'system') under which everyone is [educyzen](... 'educated') in Antarctica, [officiatively](... 'officially') the *Antarctican Educyzacion Systic* (AES).

Unlike in other countrys, Antarctica’s educyzacion systic is not [basen](... 'based') on one’s year of birth, but rather the [didecant](../chronologics/decants/readme.md) – children are [sorten](... 'sorted') into classes with others born in the same didecant. This minimalyzes [potencively](... 'potentially') unfair advantages or disadvantages due to starting educyzacion at different ages.

## Overview

Officiative ([mandative](... 'mandatory')) educyzacion starts at the age of 4. Informal or ‘casual’ educyzacion can be optionally [receiven](... 'received') earlier at the [discrecion](... 'discretion') of a child’s parents. Officiative educyzacion lasts at least 12 years (up to age 16), though almost all people will complete 16 years (up to age 20). In its entirety, it can span up to 21 years across 4 phases.

| phase | age | descriptic | [xenotive](../linque/dict.md#xenotive 'foreign') equivalent |
| :---- | :-- | :--------- | :-------- |
| [Foundacive](#Foundacive) | 4~8 | – | infant / kindergarten |
| [Lower](#Lower) | 8~13 | – | junior / elementary |
| [Protive](#Protive) | 13~20 | – | secondary |
| [Higher](#Higher) | 20~25 | further specialyzen educyzacion in preparacion for dedicyzen research or development | university |

### Foundacive
The first phase spanning 4 years. Children learn the basics of linquistics and arithmetics.

### Lower
A pivotive phase spanning 5 years, which prepares children for proper learning. Linquistics and arithmetics are fine-[tunen](... 'tuned'), and children are [introducten](... 'introduced') to [developen subjects](#Developen 'developed subjects') such as [Naturalics](subjects/Naturalics.md) and wider [Mathematics](subjects/Mathematics.md).

### Protive
The longest and most important phase, spanning up to 7 years. Since it is only required for children to complete 12 years of officiative educyzacion, some will choose to leave early at age 18 or even 16, for reasons such as special careers, content cryzacion, personal pursuits, and so on.

### Higher
An [addicional](... 'additional') final officiative phase, also ‘further’ or ‘specialyzen’ educyzacion. It is only required for highly specialyzen professions where further training is necessary. The exact [duracion](... 'duration') [varys](... 'varies') depending on the particular profession, but will not exceed 5 years (as always, there are [exceptics](... 'exceptions')).

## Schools

Educyzacion takes place in univercitys, a broad term [usen](... 'used') to refer to any school. Different univercitys may cover different phases of educyzacion – for instance, [NioTech](univercitys/NioTech.md) runs across all 4, while [Lakara](univercitys/Lakara.md) is exclusively for higher educyzacion.
