# Lore of Antarctica

Antarctican lore contains the storys, characters, aspects relyzing to Antarctica, said to have once [existen](... 'existed'). It is a vital part of Antarctican culture, significantly influencing [tradicions](... 'traditions'), [festivitys](... 'festivals'), and especially [nascional](... 'national') [heart](../home/National%20Heart.md).

It is distinct from [Antarctican historics](../historics/readme.md), in that much of it is told and [inheriten](... 'inherited') through [generyzacions](... 'generations'), and it is not certain that they occurred or existed exactly as is [descripten](... 'described') nowadays. However, there is some overlap, particularly in very ancient history – lack of surviving physical evidence results in unclear or uncertain [informacion](... 'information') – so these can often be [classyzen](... 'classified') as both history and lore.
