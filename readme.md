# Antarctica

Welcome to [Antarctica](home/readme.md), a [fictive](logistics/linque/readme.md 'fictional') [nascion](logistics/linque/dict.md#nascion 'nation') [cryzen](logistics/linque/dict.md#cryze 'created') by [Sup#2.0](https://github.com/Sup2point0). You can discover all about it [here](home/Antarctica.md).

### What’s the point of all this?
Antarctica is my ultimate [cryzacion](logistics/linque/dict.md#cryzacion 'creation'). I absolutely love [cryzing](logistics/linque/dict.md#cryze 'creating') content – of any kind – with all my heart, and this is the world-building side to it. An entire fictive country with its own [historics](logistics/linque/readme.md 'history') and lore. Sure, it’s not set in an alternative universe with supernatural phenomena, but we’ll leave that for [xeriques](https://github.com/Sup2point0/Assort/blob/origin/xeriques.md) and [affine](https://github.com/Sup2point0/Assort/blob/origin/affine). You want more? It’s all [here](https://github.com/Sup2point0/Assort).

### Why Antarctica?
What can I say, it’s just a cool place. With a cool name too. And a cool flag. Cool everything.

### What’s up with the language?
*[Linque](logistics/linque/dict.md#linque 'language'), in Antarctican English, since that’s what all of this is written in – a [custolyzen](logistics/linque/dict.md#custolyze 'customised') [varient](logistics/linque/readme.md 'variant') of English with cooler and more [consistant](logistcs/linque/readme.md 'consistent') spelling. Grammar remains identical, so reading shouldn’t be too hard (hopefully). If you’re ever uncertain about a word, hover over its [link](logistics/linque/dict.md 'watch out for these!') to view its standard English equivalent.

### What’s all this for?
For personal enjoyment, that’s all. And for the stray soul to delve into and read! The database is [utilyzen](logistics/linque/readme.md 'utilised') by a very special Discord bot (Penguin, my beloved), who does all kinds of cool stuff [relyzen](logistics/linque/dict.md#relyze 'related') to Antarctica.

### Where did you find the inspiration?
In all honesty, I don’t even know how this all started. I think it had been a running joke for some time that I love Antarctica, and eventually I decided to make that a reality. So I took a [privative](logistics/linque/readme.md 'private') Discord testing server, and turned it into a [representacion](logistics/linque/readme.md 'representation') of Antarctica, with channels and roles each representing some fictive aspect. Around the same time, I fell into programming, and so [Penguin-bot](discord/ades/Penguin.md) was born, a Discord bot [coden](logistics/linque/readme.md 'coded') in Python. Of course, it needed a purpose, and its [protic](logistics/linque/dict.md#protic '‘primary purpose’') became providing [informacion](logistics/linque/readme.md 'information') on Antarctica – which is what this is. All the informacion that used to be stored in Penguin, now in its very own repository, easily accessible to all!

### What does ‘frequerys’ even mean?
